My Base Theme and DB Admin
==========================

This package contains two major components:-
1. My Base Theme - This is a WordPress theme used for most of my web sites
   and is based upon the 'Underscores' framework theme. It is intended to be
   used in conjunction with a child theme created for each individual site.
2. DB Admin - This is a framework for creating a database admin front end. It
   is specifically designed to work on a WordPress site using My Base Theme and
   an associated child theme.

This package also contains a number of miscellaneous library files used in one
or more of my web sites.
