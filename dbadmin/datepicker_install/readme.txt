The directory 'datepicker' (under the same parent directory as this) contains a
copy of version 5.1.0 of the jQuery Datepicker package (see
http://keith-wood.name/datepick.html). It is released by the author under the
MIT licence.

This directory contains:-

1. The ZIP file for the Datepicker package, for extraction into the target
   directory.
2. A copy of the relevant jQuery library script, to be copied into the target
   directory with the Datepicker package. This is also covered by the MIT
   licence.
3. Copies of all files that have either been modified from or added to the
   original Datepicker package - within a directory tree corresponding to that
   in the target directory.
